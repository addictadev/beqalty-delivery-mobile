# 🚀 CI/CD Setup Guide - Flutter App with Slack Integration

## 📋 Overview
This guide explains how to set up automated CI/CD pipeline for your Flutter app that automatically builds APK and sends notifications to Slack team channels.

## 🎯 What This System Does
- **Automatic Build**: Every push to main/dev branches triggers APK build
- **Slack Notifications**: Team gets notified in real-time about build status
- **APK Distribution**: APK files are automatically uploaded as artifacts
- **Release Management**: Automatic GitHub releases for main branch builds

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

### 1. GitHub Repository
- Repository must be public or have GitHub Actions enabled
- Proper branch protection rules (recommended)

### 2. Slack Workspace
- Admin access to create apps and integrations
- Dedicated channels for notifications

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Slack App

1. Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click "Create New App" → "From scratch"
3. Name: `Flutter CI/CD Bot`
4. Workspace: Select your team workspace

### Step 2: Configure Slack App Permissions

1. Go to "OAuth & Permissions"
2. Add these Bot Token Scopes:
   - `chat:write` - Send messages to channels
   - `files:write` - Upload files (optional)
   - `channels:read` - Read channel information

3. Install app to workspace
4. Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`)

### Step 3: Add Slack Token to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add:
   - **Name**: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: `xoxb-your-token-here`

### Step 4: Create Slack Channels

Create these channels in your Slack workspace:
- `#app-builds` - For build notifications and APK links
- `#team-notifications` - For general team updates
- `#ci-cd-alerts` - For build failures and alerts

### Step 5: Test the Setup

1. Make a small change to your code
2. Push to main or dev branch
3. Check GitHub Actions tab
4. Verify Slack notifications

## 📱 Workflow Features

### 🔄 Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main/dev**: Triggers build and notification
- **Pull Request**: Triggers build for code review
- **Manual trigger**: Available in GitHub Actions

### 📊 Build Process
1. **Code Checkout**: Latest code from branch
2. **Environment Setup**: Java 17 + Flutter 3.24.5
3. **Dependencies**: `flutter pub get`
4. **Code Analysis**: `flutter analyze`
5. **Testing**: `flutter test`
6. **APK Build**: `flutter build apk --release`
7. **Artifact Upload**: APK saved for 30 days
8. **Slack Notification**: Team gets notified

### 🎨 Notification Types

#### ✅ Success Notification
- Build completed successfully
- APK download link
- Ready for testing

#### ❌ Failure Notification
- Build failed
- Error details and logs
- Next steps for fixing

#### 📱 APK Information
- Build number and commit details
- Download instructions
- Testing checklist

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### GitHub Secrets
- Never commit tokens or sensitive data
- Use repository secrets for all sensitive values
- Rotate tokens regularly

### Slack Permissions
- Minimal required permissions only
- Regular audit of app permissions
- Remove unused integrations

## 🚀 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Build Variants
```yaml
- name: Build APK
  run: |
    flutter build apk --release --flavor production
    flutter build apk --release --flavor staging
```

### Multiple Slack Channels
```yaml
- name: Notify Different Teams
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    channel: '#dev-team'
    text: "Dev build ready for testing"
```

### Conditional Notifications
```yaml
- name: Notify Only on Main Branch
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### GitHub Actions Insights
- Build success/failure rates
- Build duration trends
- Resource usage

### Slack Analytics
- Message engagement
- Channel activity
- Team response times

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Fails
1. Check Flutter version compatibility
2. Verify all dependencies are available
3. Check Java version requirements

#### Slack Notifications Not Working
1. Verify bot token is correct
2. Check bot is added to channels
3. Verify bot permissions

#### APK Not Uploading
1. Check file path in workflow
2. Verify build completed successfully
3. Check GitHub Actions logs

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test Flutter locally
flutter doctor
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --release

# Check GitHub Actions
gh run list
gh run view --log
```
